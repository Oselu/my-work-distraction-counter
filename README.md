## A simple app that helps me COUNT MY DISTRACTIONS
With this app i can count how many times i get distracted while doing deep work to oepn twitter, youtube or pick up my phone.

The app is very manual as at the time of uploading this to github (Dec 16TH 2024). That means whenever I get distracted, I manually go to the counter and 
log it in the counter as 1. iDEALLY, THIS SHOULD BE AUTOMATIC AND A LOT OF FUNCTIONALITIES CAN be added to make it nimble and fun to use. for example, a timer,
history etc

The level of the app shows where my programming level is currently. I hope to come back to this in the near future to add newer lines of code to make it better. Until then!
